//! Certified Null Operation in Rust
//!
//! A program that does absolutely nothing at the application level.
//! Exits with code 0 (success) without any observable side effects.
//!
//! Properties:
//! - Terminates immediately
//! - No I/O operations
//! - No heap allocations
//! - Exit code 0
//!
//! Build: cargo build --release
//! Run: ./target/release/absolute-zero

fn main() {
    // Empty main - the minimal CNO in Rust
    // At the application level, this computes nothing observable.
}

// Verification notes:
// - Rust runtime is minimal (no GC, no runtime scheduler)
// - No std library features used
// - At application level: CNO
// - At binary level: near-minimal executable
//
// This demonstrates Rust's zero-cost abstractions:
// an empty main produces a minimal binary.
