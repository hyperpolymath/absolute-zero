== Current Status (v1.0.0-alpha, 65%)

* **81 Coq proofs completed** (Qed) across 10 modules
* **19 proofs remaining** (Admitted) across 6 modules
* **4 modules fully complete**: CNO.v, CNOCategory.v, StatMech.v, StatMech_helpers.v
* **6 proof systems**: Coq, Lean 4, Z3, Agda, Isabelle, Mizar (stub)
* **License**: PMPL-1.0-or-later (migration from AGPL complete)

== Immediate Priority: Proof Completion

See link:PROOF-INSIGHTS.md[PROOF-INSIGHTS.md] for detailed proof strategies.

=== Easy (can be completed now)
* QuantumCNO.v: quantum_state_eq_refl/sym/trans (need Cexp axioms)
* MalbolgeCore.v: 1 proof (needs classification)

=== Medium (requires careful work)
* QuantumCNO.v: global_phase_is_cno, quantum_cno_composition (fix Cexp bug)
* FilesystemCNO.v: 6 proofs (needs analysis)

=== Hard (may need axiomatization)
* LandauerDerivation.v: 3 proofs (needs measure theory)
* LambdaCNO.v: y_not_cno (non-termination reasoning)
* QuantumMechanicsExact.v: 3 proofs (likely axiom-level)

== Near-Term Milestones

=== v0.8.0 - Compliance Sprint
* [ ] Complete 12-15 of 19 remaining proofs
* [x] License migration to PMPL-1.0-or-later
* [ ] Migrate Python interpreters to Rust
* [ ] Remove npm/package.json dependencies
* [ ] Complete checkpoint files

=== v0.9.0 - Container Verification
* [ ] Containerfile with all 6 proof systems
* [ ] Automated proof checking in CI
* [ ] Cross-architecture testing (amd64, arm64)

=== v1.0.0 - Publication Release
* [ ] Zero Admitted in core proofs (or justified axioms)
* [ ] Peer-reviewed paper submitted
* [ ] 3 industrial CNO examples
* [ ] Full RSR compliance

== Long-Term Vision (v2-v12)

See link:ROADMAP-V1-TO-V12.adoc[ROADMAP-V1-TO-V12.adoc] for the full
7-year roadmap covering language expansion, AI-assisted proving,
quantum verification, and standardization.

== Key Relationships

* **ECHIDNA**: Security scanning - potential CNO verification integration
* **Valence Shell**: Filesystem operations proved in FilesystemCNO.v
* **echidnabot**: GitHub bot for automated proof checking in PRs
