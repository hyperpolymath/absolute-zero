== Executive Summary

This roadmap charts Absolute Zero's evolution from a research prototype (current v1.0.0-alpha at 50%) through v1.0 release to v12.0 — a comprehensive formal verification platform for computational nullity.

**Timeline**: 18 months (v1.0) → 7 years (v12.0)

**Vision**: Transform from academic proof-of-concept to production-ready verification infrastructure used by compiler writers, security researchers, and formal methods practitioners worldwide.

---

== Current State (v1.0.0-alpha, 50%)

=== Completed ✅
* **Core Theory**: 6 proof systems, 22 theorems, ~7000 lines of proof code
* **Multi-Prover Verification**: Coq, Lean 4, Z3, Agda, Isabelle, (Mizar pending)
* **Advanced Modules**: Statistical mechanics, category theory, lambda calculus, quantum, filesystem
* **Research Foundation**: Paper drafts, examples, documentation

=== Technical Debt ⚠️
* Python interpreters (violates RSR language policy → migrate to Julia/Rust)
* npm/package.json (violates Deno-only policy)
* License inconsistencies (AGPL references → PMPL-1.0-or-later)
* Incomplete checkpoint files (ECOSYSTEM.scm needs detail)
* Container verification not validated

=== Gaps for v1.0
* No publication-ready paper
* Missing industrial applications
* No GUI/visualization tools
* Limited language coverage (only esoteric languages)
* No integration with existing verification ecosystems

---

== Phase 1: Road to v1.0 (MVP) — 6 Months

**Goal**: Production-ready research artifact with published paper

== Conclusion

Absolute Zero has the potential to transform from a research curiosity into foundational computer science infrastructure. By systematically expanding from esoteric languages to mainstream compilers, from manual proofs to AI-assisted proving, and from academic prototypes to industrial platforms, we can establish **Certified Null Operations** as a universal computational primitive.

**The vision**: In 2032, every compiler, every proof assistant, and every verification tool will have CNO detection built-in. Absolute Zero will be the reference implementation, the theoretical foundation, and the community hub for this transformation.

**Next step**: Execute Phase 1 (v1.0) to prove the concept, then secure funding for the 7-year journey to v12.0.
